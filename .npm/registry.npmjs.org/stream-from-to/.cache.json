destinations.\n\nPass stream-from-to a function that creates a [through](https://npmjs.org/package/through) stream and it'll give you back an object that simplifies the constructon of source and destination streams for piping to/from the through stream.\n\nUsage examples\n---\n\n```javascript\nvar streamft = require(\"stream-from-to\")\n  , through = require(\"through\")\n\nvar mdToHtml = function (filePath) {\n  // Through stream that converts markdown to HTML\n  return through()\n}\n\nstreamft(mdToHtml).from.path(\"/path/to/doc.md\").to.path(\"/path/to/doc.html\", function (er) {\n    if (er) return console.error(er)\n    // Done!\n})\n```\n\nWith [brfs](https://github.com/substack/brfs):\n\n```javascript\nvar streamft = require(\"stream-from-to\")\n  , brfs = require(\"brfs\")\n\nstreamft(brfs).from(\"src/index.js\").to(\"dist/index.js\")\n```\n\nAPI\n---\n\n### from.path(path, opts)\n\nCreate a readable stream from `path` and pipe to the through stream. `path` can be a single path or array of paths.\n\n### from.string(string)\n\nCreate a readable stream from `string` and pipe to the through stream. `string` can be a single string or array of strings.\n\n### concat.from.paths(paths, opts)\n\nCreate and concatinate readable streams from `paths` and pipe to the through stream.\n\n### concat.from.strings(strings, opts)\n\nCreate and concatinate readable streams from `strings` and pipe to the through stream.\n\n### to.path(path, cb)\n\nCreate a writeable stream to `path` and pipe output from the through stream to it. `path` can be a single path, or array of output paths if you specified an array of inputs. The callback function `cb` will be invoked when data has finished being written.\n\n### to.buffer(opts, cb)\n\nCreate a [concat-stream](https://npmjs.org/package/concat-stream) and pipe output from the through stream to it. The callback function `cb` will be invoked when the buffer has been created.\n\n### to.string(opts, cb)\n\nCreate a [concat-stream](https://npmjs.org/package/concat-stream) and pipe output from the through stream to it. The callback function `cb` will be invoked when the string has been created.","maintainers":[{"name":"alanshaw","email":"alan138@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-04-20T08:17:58.750Z","created":"2013-12-14T17:34:31.311Z","0.0.0":"2013-12-14T17:34:33.947Z","0.0.1":"2013-12-15T12:40:54.693Z","1.0.0":"2013-12-15T17:56:44.737Z","1.1.0":"2013-12-15T20:12:38.549Z","1.2.0":"2013-12-27T17:45:35.877Z","1.3.0":"2013-12-29T00:01:04.906Z","1.4.0":"2014-01-30T20:56:49.853Z","1.4.1":"2015-01-25T20:32:35.024Z","1.4.2":"2015-03-16T07:06:33.083Z","1.4.3":"2016-04-20T08:17:58.750Z"},"author":{"name":"Alan Shaw"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+ssh://git@github.com/alanshaw/stream-from-to.git"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/alanshaw/stream-from-to","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/alanshaw/stream-from-to/issues"},"license":"MIT","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"17UNYZ3V2Z4233Y95V62VLVJB\""}
